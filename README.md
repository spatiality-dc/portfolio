## Challenge

Create a responsive website using the Bootstrap framework.

Using the Bootstrap CSS framework

## User-Story

AS A visitor to my online portfolio<br>
I WANT website that is responsive to break points for different viewports<br>
SO THAT when people access my portfolio, no matter the browser or device, they can navigate it easily<br>

## AcceptanceCriteria

GIVEN a deployed webpage featuring an Index page, a Portfolio page and a Contact page, a navigation bar and a sticky footer<br>
WHEN I view the website on different browsers and devices<br>
THEN I can see the page elements optimise for different viewer break points <br>

### Bootstrap

I used the Bootstrap CSS framework as a base, but added in additional style sheets for my own preference.

In keeping with the "cascading" style of CSS hierarchy, I added my additional style sheet after the Bootstrap link. I also took care to limit the number of changes to styled items, adding in specific class names that were not likely to interfere with the Bootstrap framework.

    * .smoke, .spacer, .footer-text

## Results
